The following syntax applies:
HEAD^(parallel parent number)
HEAD~(linear ancestor number)

E.g.
 If you have a commit A which has two parents B and C (someone screwed
up with a merge). Also consider a D that is B's parent:
(HEAD)A---B---D
      \---C

HEAD = A
HEAD^ == HEAD^1 = B (1st parent)
HEAD^2 = C (2nd parent)
HEAD^3 = N/A (only two parents)

HEAD~ = B
HEAD~2 = D (parent of the first parent) = HEAD^^1 = HEAD^1^1

HEAD^2^1 would yield the (first) parent of C. This notation is
impossible using only tilda~

The following equivalences apply:
HEAD = HEAD
HEAD^ = HEAD~
HEAD^^ = HEAD~2
HEAD^^^ = HEAD~3
...

Both syntaxes can be stacked:
HEAD~3^2 - (second parent of the third previous commit)
